Project Description:
The To-Do List Application is a web-based task management tool designed to help users organize and keep track of their daily tasks and activities. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks, set priorities, and mark tasks as completed. The application provides a clean and intuitive user interface to enhance the user experience in managing their to-do lists efficiently.

Skills Used:

1) HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):
Used to structure the content of the web page.
Created elements such as forms, buttons, and lists for user interaction.
Implemented the overall layout and structure of the application.

2) CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
Styled the HTML elements to enhance the visual appeal of the application.
Defined the color scheme, fonts, and spacing to create a cohesive design.
Implemented responsive design for various screen sizes and devices.

3) JavaScript (JS):
Utilized JavaScript for dynamic and interactive features.
Implemented functionality for adding, editing, and deleting tasks without the need for page reloads.
Managed user input and interactions to update the task list dynamically.
Used JavaScript to validate user inputs and provide real-time feedback.

4) DOM Manipulation (Document Object Model):
Interacted with the DOM to dynamically update the content of the web page.
Altered the structure and style of the HTML elements based on user actions.

5) Event Handling:
Implemented event listeners to capture user actions like button clicks and keyboard inputs.
Responded to events by triggering appropriate JavaScript functions for task manipulation.

6) LocalStorage:
Utilized LocalStorage to store and retrieve task data on the client side, enabling data persistence even after page refresh.
Version Control (Optional):

Used version control systems like Git to track changes in the codebase, facilitating collaboration and code management.
By combining these skills, the To-Do List Application provides users with a seamless and efficient way to manage their tasks through a visually appealing and responsive web interface.
